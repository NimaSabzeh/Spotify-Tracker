### PLEASE RUN "npm install" TO INSTALL EXPRESS
* Run the server by typing "npm run start" in the terminal.
### IF YOU WANT TO SIGN IN WITH YOUR SPOTIFY ACCOUNT, OPEN THE SERVER USING EXPRESS
* The Spotify Api redirects the user back to the connection page (so it assumes you have opened the server in http://localhost:8888/index.html?page=connection) (which is only possible using express).
### Preferred screen resolution
* Desktop = 1920 x 1080px
* Mobile (iPhone 12 Pro) = 390 x 844

### NOTE
* YOU DON"T HAVE TO SIGN IN TO YOUR SPOTIFY ACCOUNT (the web app also functions without the need for the user to sign in, it just can't access users specific data anymore)
* Because the fonts, Spotify data, and the carousel are imported from online resources, they might take some while to load (needs internet access).
* As a recommendation (for understanding the code more easily), read the README file first, then the index.html file (comments), then the Spotify.js file, then the script.js file, and finally the style.css file

# General Information

* All data represented in the web app change in real time according to Spotify.
* The users can either use the form (included in the Collection page), to serach for tracks using 3 different inputs, including: genre, artist and/or track name; Or sign in with their Spotify account.(Which by doing so, their top tracks will be added to the web app collection).
* After adding songs to the collection, the users can track their information (Track page), including: the total time (calculated by summing up the duration of all tracks), their main artists and genres. There also exists a graph representation of the time spent listening to music during the past week (but all days are filled with dummy data, except Sunday which changes according to the collection)
* In the main page, if the users like one of the genres displayed in the carousel, or one of Today's top hits songs, they can click on the corresponding item which will autofill the form (Collection page) and find related data (which can be added to their collection).
